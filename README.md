# reddit-client

This is the Codecademy front-end capstone project: make a new front-end interface for Reddit using React.

This was built by me, Rachel Kaufman, and my collaborator, [Logan](https://github.com/l4lilul3lo). We used React and React Bootstrap to create the layout, Redux to manage state, and RTK Query to handle the API calls to Reddit.

"Calm Reddit" is viewable online [here](http://calm-reddit.surge.sh). Users can view the most popular posts on Reddit or search for a keyword. Results can be sorted by date, upvotes or comments, and users can view a minimalist version of a full post and top-level comments.

The project has some limited testing in Jest, using MSW to mock the API calls. Future iterations will have more complete code coverage.
